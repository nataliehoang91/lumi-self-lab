## Privacy Reminder Copy

### Dialog Title:
```
🔒 Privacy Protected
```

### Content:
```
Your organization will see:
• Aggregate patterns (e.g., "Team mood averages 7.2/10")
• Participation rates
• Trend insights (e.g., "Focus scores are 15% higher on Tuesdays")

Your organization will NOT see:
• Your personal reflections
• Your text responses
• Your individual check-in data
• Your name attached to specific data points

Think of it like a weather report: useful patterns emerge, but no one knows if it rained on your specific street.

[I understand, continue] [Cancel]
```

### Alternative (Shorter):
```
Before you link this experiment

Linking this experiment to [Org Name] means your aggregate data (like average scores) will contribute to team insights.

Your personal reflections and text responses will always remain private—even if linked.

You can unlink this experiment anytime from the experiment settings.

[I understand, link experiment] [Cancel]
```

## Help & Guidance Text

### What is an Experiment?
```
An experiment is a structured way to understand yourself better. You define what you want to track, check in regularly, and discover patterns in your own data.

Think of it like a personal research project—but just for you.
```

### What are Organizations?
```
Organizations let teams share experiment templates and view aggregate insights. When you link an experiment to an organization, you contribute to collective understanding while keeping your personal reflections private.

You're always in control of what's shared.
```

### Privacy Explained:
```
Privacy is at the heart of Self-Lab. Here's how it works:

Personal Experiments:
• Completely private to you
• No one else can see your data
• You can link to an organization later if you want

Organization-Linked Experiments:
• Your personal reflections stay private
• Only aggregate patterns are shared (like average scores)
• You can unlink anytime

Text Responses:
• Always private, even if linked to an organization
• Never shared with anyone
• Only you can see your written reflections
```
